Packet loss appears to be an inevitable issue in computing and has spurred the development of systems to mitigate its effects for decades. A prime example of such a system is Digital Fountain Codes developed by Michael Luby at his company Digital Fountain (reference), published in 2002. A Digital Fountain Code (DFC) is a type of sparse-graph code designed for transmission channels that have erasure. In practice, DFCs are a robust and efficient solution for transmitting data in a lossless manner and with a low cost.
